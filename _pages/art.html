    <h2>Random Haiku</h2>
    To make my 33rd year more interesting, and hopefully prevent it from blending in with all the others, I wrote a haiku to reflect every day. Enjoy a randomly selected poem from that year. To view the full catalog, click <a href="/haikus/">here</a>.

    Inspired by <a href="https://glasscannonnetwork.com/">Skid Maher of the GCP</a>, the original HaikuBoy.
