My name is Simon Hans Edasi and I am driven in pursuit of morally uncompromising challenge. I am a recent graduate from University of Washington with a background in machine learning, data analysis, statistical analysis, and geophysics. In years past I served honorably as a U.S. Air Force aircraft maintenance craftsman as well as an accounts receivable clerk.
