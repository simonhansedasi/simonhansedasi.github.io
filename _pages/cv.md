Summary
======
I combine the inquisitive spirit of a scientist with the precise skill of a maintenance technician form a unique
skillset capable of achieving anything. My background lies in geophysics, statistics, and data science, and I seek to
tackle complex problems facing our communities. Experienced in fast paced environments and prioritizing for
deadlines, I am seeking a challenge for which to apply my skills and help others.

Education
======
* M.S. Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington, 2024
  <!-- * Thesis: A Data Driven Estimate of Glacier Thicknesses Reveals the Influence of Ice Shelves and Other Ocean Interactions -->
  * Automated construction of glacier database combining remotely-sensed glacier surface attributes with a much smaller database of thickness measurements using geographic coordinates contained in both datasets.
  * Established thresholds of reliability of matched data to be used in regression analysis. Time differences between datasets may make some thickness measurements unreliable for a measured surface area.
  * Employed neural networks and leave-one-out cross-validation to perform regression analysis with mean thickness as the target variable and remotely-sensed surface attributes as independent variables.
  * Contributed to existing knowledge by highlighting impacts of glacier termination dynamics on distributions of glacier ice thickness, a fact frequently overlooked in glacier modeling.


* B.S. Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington, 2019
  * Minor in Mathematical Physics and Estonian
  * Dean’s list for five quarters, and annual dean’s list 2014-2015.
  * Course work in continuum mechanics, geophysics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, linear algebra, and differential equations.


Specialized Coursework
======
* Photonic Sensing
  * Studied fundamentals of optical physics in application of distributed seismic sensing using optical fiber networks.
  * Wrote code to automate filtering of raw data collected by Distributed Acoustic Sensing equipment connected to dark commercial fiber under Seattle, WA. Filtered data was then used to analyze city traffic patterns.
* Statistical Inferences in Ecology
  * Studied experimental design and a multitude of tests and methods to determine statistical significance in data.
* Geoscience Communication
  * Developed writing skills to convey complex ideas in different styles and applications.
  * Collaborated with classmates on a capstone research project and presentation discussing the future of energy.
* Geophysical Continuum Mechanics
  * Applied constitutive laws of stress and strain to the context of geological materials and the Earth’s lithosphere.
* Seismology
  * Examined stress and strain, the wave equation, travel times, amplitude and phase, reflection seismology, surface waves, and source theory, including moment tensors, radiation patterns, far-field wave shapes, source spectra, stress drop, and magnitude.





Work experience
======
* 2019 - 2021: University of Washington
  * Research Assistant in ESS IsoLab
  * Supervisor: Dr. Alexis Licht
    * Powdered, weighed, and de-carbonated paleosol rock samples. Measured organic and inorganic carbon content for analysis and paleoclimate reconstruction.
    * Contributed data for published article: "Proto-monsoon rainfall and greening in Central Asia due to extreme early Eocene warmth"
* 2017 - 2022: University of Washington
  * Administrative Assistant
    * Created, administered, and collected invoice payments for lab work by UW Earth & Space Sciences IsoLab, Geochemistry Lab, Microprobe, and World Wide Lightning Location Network.
    * Managed department financial records: Responsible for assembling, completing, and reconciling paperwork for transactions; maintained in-office records and interacted with archival records as needed for audit.
    * Developed tool for managing online budget reconciliation status and email notification automation.
* 2008 - 2014: U.S. Air Force
  * AWACS Communication & Navigation Maintenance Technician and Isochronal Inspection
    * Maintained communication and navigation equipment on board fleet of Airborne Warning And Control System aircraft in Elmendorf AFB, AK and Tinker AFB, OK.
    * Managed secret cryptographic programs responsible for safety of assets and flightcrew during engagement operations
    * Executed annual inspection of all communication and navigation equipment on board fleet of AWACS aircraft to ensure long-term operability.
    * Attended Airman Leadership School for promotion to Staff Sergeant, and achieved craftsman maintenance skill level, capable of clearing aircraft as safe to fly.
    * Trained, mentored, and supervised junior airmen, directly responsible for on the job training and professional development.
* 2006 - 2008: Nibley Park Golf Course
  * Driving range and fairway ranger
    * Responsible for collecting, washing, and maintaining supply of driving range golf balls. Also responsible for cleanliness and availability of golf carts and push carts.
    * Fast paced environment, strategic problem solving, prioritization of tasks, customer service.


Proficiencies
======
* Languages
  * English (native), Estonian (conversational)
* Linux

Service
======
* UW Graduate and Professional Student Senator
  * Legislated in the UW Graduate and Professional Student Senate representing the rights and interests of over 15,000 graduate and professional students at the University of Washington. Procured funding for two departmental retreats and a picnic table to socialize on the department patio.
* UAW 4121 Academic Student Employee Union
  * Recruited student employees in departments across campus to join the union ahead of contract bargaining, and helped rally student employees to strike when bargaining failed to reach a fair contract.
* Whale Scout
  * Volunteered to plant bushes and shrubs on an abandoned golf course. This project is meant to restore natural waterways that support local salmon populations and ultimately orcas in the Puget Sound.
* Airmen Against Drunk Driving
  * Received calls and offered rides for hot-line for airmen to call for a free ride home to prevent drunk driving.
