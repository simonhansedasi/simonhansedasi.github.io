Summary
======
I combine the inquisitive spirit of a scientist with the precise hands of a maintenance technician form a unique skillset capable of achieving anything. My background lies in geophysics, statistics, and data science, and I seek to tackle complex problems facing our communities. Experienced in fast paced environments and prioritizing for deadlines, I am seeking a challenge for which to apply my skills and help others.

Education
======
* M.S. Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington, 2024
  <!-- * Thesis: A Data Driven Estimate of Glacier Thicknesses Reveals the Influence of Ice Shelves and Other Ocean Interactions -->
  * Automated construction of a glacier thickness database by combining two separate catalogs, creating a dataset for regression analysis to determine mean glacier thickness dependence on surface attributes.
  * Employed neural networks and leave-one-out cross-validation to infer glacier thickness as a dependent variable from observable attributes.
  * Contributed to existing knowledge by highlighting impacts of glacier termination dynamics on distributions of glacier ice thickness, a fact frequently overlooked in glacier modeling.

* B.S. Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington, 2019
  * Minor in Mathematical Physics and Estonian
  * Course work in continuum mechanics, geophysics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, linear algebra, and differential equations.
