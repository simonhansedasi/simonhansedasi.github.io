Coursework
======
* ESS 411 -- Geophysical Continuum Mechanics
  * Analysis of stress and strain. Measurement and interpretation of strain in geological materials. Elasticity applied to determine stress in the Earth's lithosphere. Creep of solids and flow of geological materials.

* ESS 418 -- Geoscience Communication
  * Covers principles of organizing, developing, and writing geoscience information including abstracts, presentations, scientific articles, correspondences, and proposals. Reviews writing conventions, use of illustrations, style, and tone.


* ESS 425 -- Tectonic Geomorphology
  * Advanced-level survey of tectonic geomorphology topics, focusing on the interplay between tectonic and surface processes that shape the landscape in regions of active deformation and at time scales ranging from days to millions of years.

* ESS 462 -- Volcanic processes
  * Pre-eruption, eruption, and post-eruption processes. Examines triggers of magma ascent, controls on volatile build-up and loss, magma fragmentation, magma-groundwater interaction, eruption column dynamics, gravity-controlled eruptive phenomena, syn- and post-eruption lahars and other re-working of deposits.



* ESS 512 -- Seismology
  * Examines stress and strain, the wave equation, travel times, amplitude and phase, reflection seismology, surface waves, and source theory, including moment tensors, radiation patterns, far-field wave shapes, source spectra, stress drop, and magnitude.


* QSCI 482 -- Statistical Inference in Applied Research
  * Analysis of variance and covariance; chi square tests; nonparametric procedures multiple and curvilinear regression; experimental design and power of tests. Application to biological problems. Use of computer programs in standard statistical problems.


Teaching
======
* Spring 2022;  ESS 102 -- Space and Space Travel
  * Explores the sun, solar storms, observations from space and from Earth; Earth's space environment, radiation belts and hazards, plasma storms and auroras, rockets and propulsion, human exploration efforts, societal impact, planetary systems and resources, and project highlighting space and its exploration.

* Autum 2023:  ESS 211 -- Physical Processes of the Earth
  * Introductory structural geology and geomorphology. Deformation of soil, sediment, and rock. Erosional and depositional processes and landforms. Structural, geomorphic, and climatic interactions in major tectonic regimes. Use of geologic maps and cross sections.


Service
======
* UW Graduate and Professional Student Senator
  * Participated in the UW Graduate and Professional Student Senate representing the rights and interests of over 15,000 graduate and professional students at the University of Washington. Procured funding for two departmental retreats and a picnic table to socialize on the department patio.

* Whale Scout
  * Volunteered to plant bushes and shrubs on an abandoned golf course. This project is meant to restore natural waterways that support local salmon populations and ultimately orcas in the Puget Sound.

* Airmen Against Drunk Driving
  * Hotline for airmen to call for a free ride home, no questions asked. Volunteered as driver and dispatcher.
