Accurate estimation of glacier volume is essential for effective water resource management and sea-level rise projections, however, traditional methods for assessing glacier thickness are costly and labor-intensive. This study presents a novel approach to estimating glacier thickness, utilizing neural networks trained on thickness data from the Glacier Thickness Database (GlaThiDa) and surface features from the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI). A regression analysis is conducted on a subset of GlaThiDa data, which is then used to infer thicknesses for RGI glaciers. This study also addresses challenges in matching data between GlaThiDa and RGI, employing distance and area thresholds to ensure accuracy. The trained neural network model demonstrates statistically similar results to previous physics-based models, highlighting the potential of data-driven approaches in estimating global glacier volume. Our findings emphasize the importance of models versus underlying data in enhancing our understanding of glacier volumes. This study provides a comprehensive comparison with existing global estimates and discusses the implications of its data-driven approach for future glacier research.
