Dungeons & Dragons and other role-playing games employ complex designs of how a player can
interact with the game via their in-game personality, known as a player character or PC. Many choices
are available to create a player character. Combinations of these choices lead to a multitude of possible
personalities and abilities available to explore. In this paper, these choices are randomized, automated,
tracked, and analyzed. Governing attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma) are randomly determined before selecting a species, class, background, and alignment
based on the rolled attributes and subjective weighting. This study generates characters according to
the suggestions in the 2014 5e Dungeons & Dragons Playerâ€™s Handbook in an attempt to quantify the
demographics of the adventuring population of Faerun.
