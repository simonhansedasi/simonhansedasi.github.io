## 2022/06/23 #113
Long travel to lunch \
Then some more mathematics \
New estimations

## 2022/06/22 #112
Integrate the functions \
Comments for the functions sake \
This doesn't make sense

## 2022/06/21 #111
Traffic flow changes \
Like clockwork, the sun rises \
Time will come and go

## 2022/06/20 #110
Morning is for code \
Afternoon is for napping \
Holidays are great

## 2022/06/19 #109
Monsters be slayin' \
Me and the boys through tunnels \
Push that hobgoblin!

## 2022/06/18 #108
Saturday rained in \
Time for laundry and kisses \
Canine tongues so soft

## 2022/06/17 #107
It's like we're at Wayne's \
Basement, but it's not Wayne's base \
ment. Isn't that weird?

## 2022/06/16 #106
It's Wednesday, my dudes! \
Wait, duh, that was yesterday \
I need my Kitty

## 2022/06/15 #105
Lasagna day three \
It is almost all gone now \
Time for sandwiches

## 2022/06/14 #104
Lasagna day two \
Already sick of the pan \
Let's go get ice cream!

## 2022/06/13 #103
First day only one \
Home is empty except dogs \
Time for us to sleep

## 2022/06/12 #102
Early departure \
My kitty is hours away \
So cold and lonely

## 2022/06/11 #101
Sleep in to drill sounds \
The neighbor in the back yard \
Sweet, a new free fence!

## 2022/06/10 #100
Making the last grades \
Don't bother me I'm working \
Never thought I'd say...

## 2022/06/09 #99
Rain rain, rain all day \
Does not matter what you do \
The rain does not care

## 2022/06/08 #98
Timing can be hard \
Luckily for others too \
Sometimes it works out

## 2022/06/07 #97
Reading about space \
Topics researched well or not \
That is up to me

## 2022/06/06 #96
Nose in my notebooks \
Chasing bugs around in code \
Got it! Squash it! Push!

## 2022/06/05 #95
Bright morning, no clouds \
Spend all day inside again \
Tomorrow again

## 2022/06/04 #94
Ahh, it's Saturday! \
Nothing going on this time \
Let's have a nice nap

## 2022/06/03 #93
Wet start with whimpers \
Kill time until happy hour \
Then it's pizza time!

## 2022/06/02 #92
Darken the room some \
Presentations should be seen \
Handfuls of people

## 2022/06/01 #91
First sun in some days \
Can't mow just yet with the pup \
Oh look, it's raining
