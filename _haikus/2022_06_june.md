## 2022/06/08 #98
Timing can be hard \
Luckily for others too \
Sometimes it works out

## 2022/06/07 #97
Reading about space \
Topics researched well or not \
That is up to me

## 2022/06/06 #96
Nose in my notebooks \
Chasing bugs around in code \
Got it! Squash it! Push!

## 2022/06/05 #95
Bright morning, no clouds \
Spend all day inside again \
Tomorrow again

## 2022/06/04 #94
Ahh, it's Saturday! \
Nothing going on this time \
Let's have a nice nap

## 2022/06/03 #93
Wet start with whimpers \
Kill time until happy hour \
Then it's pizza time!

## 2022/06/02 #92
Darken the room some \
Presentations should be seen \
Handfuls of people

## 2022/06/01 #91
First sun in some days \
Can't mow just yet with the pup \
Oh look, it's raining
