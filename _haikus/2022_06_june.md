## 2022/06/16 #106
It's Wednesday, my dudes! \
Wait, duh, that was yesterday \
I need my Kitty

## 2022/06/15 #105
Lasagna day three \
It is almost all gone now \
Time for sandwiches

## 2022/06/14 #104
Lasagna day two \
Already sick of the pan \
Let's go get ice cream!

## 2022/06/13 #103
First day only one \
Home is empty except dogs \
Time for us to sleep

## 2022/06/12 #102
Early departure \
My kitty is hours away \
So cold and lonely

## 2022/06/11 #101
Sleep in to drill sounds \
The neighbor in the back yard \
Sweet, a new free fence!

## 2022/06/10 #100
Making the last grades \
Don't bother me I'm working \
Never thought I'd say...

## 2022/06/09 #99
Rain rain, rain all day \
Does not matter what you do \
The rain does not care

## 2022/06/08 #98
Timing can be hard \
Luckily for others too \
Sometimes it works out

## 2022/06/07 #97
Reading about space \
Topics researched well or not \
That is up to me

## 2022/06/06 #96
Nose in my notebooks \
Chasing bugs around in code \
Got it! Squash it! Push!

## 2022/06/05 #95
Bright morning, no clouds \
Spend all day inside again \
Tomorrow again

## 2022/06/04 #94
Ahh, it's Saturday! \
Nothing going on this time \
Let's have a nice nap

## 2022/06/03 #93
Wet start with whimpers \
Kill time until happy hour \
Then it's pizza time!

## 2022/06/02 #92
Darken the room some \
Presentations should be seen \
Handfuls of people

## 2022/06/01 #91
First sun in some days \
Can't mow just yet with the pup \
Oh look, it's raining
