## 2022/08/31 #183
I visualize \
Features scattered through the globe \
I will organize


## 2022/08/30 #182
Sleeping in is nice \
Requires midnight waking \
Still, it's worth it


## 2022/08/29 #181
Anniversary \
We swim in our continued \
Devotion for us


## 2022/08/28 #180
Another giant \
This one falls for his allies \
The big daddy comes


## 2022/08/27 #179
Still in the spirit \
Love is our language of love \
Farmer's markets rock!

## 2022/08/26 #178
Waiting all day long \
A confectioner's delight \
Lemon cake for us


## 2022/08/25 #177
To my sweet Kitty \
Happy anniversary \
I love you so much

## 2022/08/24 #176
Day before the day \
Think of what to accomplish \
We will write them down

## 2022/08/23 #175
So much is written \
A long lunch is now deserved \
Relax with a book

## 2022/08/22 #174
Spilling my words out \
Others will need this info \
It must all be clear

## 2022/08/21 #173
Long day before now \
Ended with a sad whimper \
Coffee fixes all

## 2022/08/20 #172
Mow the dormant lawn \
Lord over your vast domain \
Friends are coming by!

## 2022/08/19 #171
One day 'til party \
Still no menu or real plan \
But we got bocce!

## 2022/08/18 #170
Early morning cries \
BB needs to go pp \
She's getting better

## 2022/08/17 #169
Yellow shorts, white shirt \
Pajamas are so comfy \
No time for real clothes

## 2022/08/16 #168
These days are blending \
Are the poems not working? \
I think that they are

## 2022/08/15 #167
Back on the sofa \
Organizing the glaciers \
So much work to do

## 2022/08/14 #166
We are battling \
Storming a volcano forge \
Battling all kinds

## 2022/08/13 #165
Putting my work down \
Harder than I thought it would \
Gaming don't do it

## 2022/08/12 #164
Today is Friday \
Another day in a slog \
At least it's Friday

## 2022/08/11 #163
Writing and writing \
Always writing some more code \
Never enough stats

## 2022/08/10 #162
Means vary by size \
It's hard to say why or how \
It might be nothing

## 2022/08/09 #161
Fresh and clean, no smell \
It assembles like legos \
Coolest bong ever

## 2022/08/08 #160
Back to the work grind \
Pretty colors in regions \
What do they all mean?

## 2022/08/07 #159
Chorin' all day long \
Just kidding, finished by lunch \
Luxuriate now

## 2022/08/06 #158
Saturday is now \
Pulling myself together \
Most change can be hard

## 2022/08/05 #157
Yet another day \
With the dots and lines I see \
model performance

## 2022/08/04 #156
Staying home with pups \
Crossplots upon plots today \
Why won't they line up?!?!

## 2022/08/03 #155
Results for the boss \
Not the right ones though, now write! \
Not bad, now submit!

## 2022/08/02 #154
Decide on a plan \
Go one by one, globally \
Individual

## 2022/08/01 #153
Prepare instructions \
Swap from big to smaller screen \
Now on the big couch
