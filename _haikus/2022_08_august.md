## 2022/08/08 #159
Back to the work grind \
Pretty colors in regions \
What do they all mean?

## 2022/08/07 #158
Chorin' all day long \
Just kidding, finished by lunch \
Luxuriate now

## 2022/08/06 #157
Saturday is now \
Pulling myself together \
Most change can be hard

## 2022/08/05 #156
Yet another day \
With the dots and lines I see \
model performance

## 2022/08/04 #155
Staying home with pups \
Crossplots upon plots today \
Why won't they line up?!?!

## 2022/08/03 #154
Results for the boss \
Not the right ones though, now write! \
Not bad, now submit!

## 2022/08/02 #153
Decide on a plan \
Go one by one, globally \
Individual

## 2022/08/01 #152
Prepare instructions \
Swap from big to smaller screen \
Now on the big couch
