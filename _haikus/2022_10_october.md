Bright and early quiz \
Proficiency determined \
Now drive through some smoke

## 2022/10/06 #218
Stay up late at night \
Meeting with fellow students \
One more job to do

## 2022/10/05 #217
A long day today \
It's supposed to be over \
I can't shut it off

## 2022/10/04 #216
Drive, park, tap, repeat \
Great, now I have a blister \
Can we see the strikes?

## 2022/10/03 #215
Already missed class \
The early morning lecture \
Was a bad idea

## 2022/10/02 #214
Climbing up the wall \
Reach the top, just sit and wait \
Gravity kicks in

## 2022/10/01 #213
First day of the Spooks \
Everything turns to orange \
Pumpkin spice the things!
