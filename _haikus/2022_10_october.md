Ghosts and ghouls abound \
Demanding candy payments \
Pay them or scrape egg

Oof, what did I do? \
Oh yeah, I can't breathe at night \
I'll get that looked at

Ever faster, shorter now \
Time is not constant

Ice volcanoes? So awesome \
Argue about ice

Midweek once again \
Race to and fro, learn a trick \
Nothing can stop me!

## 2022/10/25 #237
Laying on the couch \
Working from home doesn't work \
I need more structure

## 2022/10/24 #236
Start the race again \
Losing my lead from the pack \
Math is really hard

Thursdays are meetings \
Oh dear god when am I free \
Free to study math

Better get started on it \
Integrate, step back

Office can stay there  \
I will work at my own pace  \
Oops, I fell asleep

## 2022/10/17 #229
Early morning bus \
These lectures are recorded \
Why go the hard way?

## 2022/10/16 #228
Resolve the attack \
Hitting the invisible \
Rules are rules I guess

## 2022/10/15 #227
A long day drive home \
Listened and talked past two days \
Now I need a nap

## 2022/10/14 #226
He sits, she sleeps, good. \
I love these dogs, but sometimes... \
I love these dogs more

Bubby gives me licks \
He is such a schmoopy boy \
Oh yeah, it's dinner

Today is special \
It is my sisters birthday \
I guess I'll text her

## 2022/10/11 #223
Book shelves over there \
Television to my right \
This is what I see

## 2022/10/10 #222
Euler and error \
Does it ever end? Hope not \
Combine math and code


## 2022/10/09 #221
Drive home, then drive out \
Slay monsters, save my marriage \
I missed my kitty

## 2022/10/08 #220
Sleeping in is nice \
Everyone typing upstairs \
Plan out my future

Bright and early quiz \
Proficiency determined \
Now drive through some smoke

Stay up late at night \
Meeting with fellow students \
One more job to do

## 2022/10/05 #217
A long day today \
It's supposed to be over \
I can't shut it off

## 2022/10/04 #216
Drive, park, tap, repeat \
Great, now I have a blister \
Can we see the strikes?

## 2022/10/03 #215
Already missed class \
The early morning lecture \
Was a bad idea

## 2022/10/02 #214
Climbing up the wall \
Reach the top, just sit and wait \
Gravity kicks in

## 2022/10/01 #213
First day of the Spooks \
Everything turns to orange \
Pumpkin spice the things!
