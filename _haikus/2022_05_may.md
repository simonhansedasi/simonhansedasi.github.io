## 2022/05/09 #68
Midnight bathroom breaks \
By dawn there is no more left \
Rest of the day tired

## 2022/05/08 #67
Late brunch with the moms \
So many pups, chaos house \
Back to the sleep race

## 2022/05/07 #66
Sun shines through rain clouds\
Babes sleeping in the back seat \
Our lives are peaceful

## 2022/05/06 #65
Friday, finally\
Lunch talks about future work \
Undersea cable

## 2022/05/05 #64
The fourth was with us \
Now we must deal with today \
Revenge of the Fifth

## 2022/05/04 #63
Midweek never slows \
Race here, race there, everywhere \
I hate Julia

## 2022/05/03 #62
Stand up and lecture \
All this info is not new \
At least there's a show

## 2022/05/02 #61
Expected to learn \
From behind a screen all day \
Eyeballs are bleeding

## 2022/05/01 #60
Restful Sunday...NOT! \
Just kidding, get your naps in \
Attacked by sharp teeth!
