Bag full of cookies and hope \
Sugar brings the friends

Tiny teeth need to go poop \
Will it ever end

Rest of the day tired

Late brunch with the moms \
So many pups, chaos house \
Back to the sleep race

Babes sleeping in the back seat \
Our lives are peaceful

Race here, race there, everywhere \
I hate Julia

Stand up and lecture \
All this info is not new \
At least there's a show

## 2022/05/02 #61
Expected to learn \
From behind a screen all day \
Eyeballs are bleeding

## 2022/05/01 #60
Restful Sunday...NOT! \
Just kidding, get your naps in \
Attacked by sharp teeth!
