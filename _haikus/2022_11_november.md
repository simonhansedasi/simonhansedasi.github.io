## 2022/11/08 #251
Coding the axes \
The beast is finally slain \
Now time for a nap

## 2022/11/07 #250
Morning meet and plan \
Discuss some stats and questions \
Where do we go now?

## 2022/11/06 #249
Gain ancient wisdom \
Restore order to the storm? \
Or avenge a ghost?

## 2022/11/05 #248
First day off in weeks \
On the couch where I belong \
Prepare tomorrow

## 2022/11/04 #247
Time is hanging down \
I can't do this anymore \
Drop that class so fast

## 2022/11/03 #246
Stabbed in the shoulder \
Disease courses through my veins \
Get sick purposely

## 2022/11/02 #245
I really need help \
Brain refuses to do math \
Assistance granted

## 2022/11/01 #244
Cold wind blasts with rain \
The sun rises, but hidden \
Gray skies for today
