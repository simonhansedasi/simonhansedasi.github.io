## 2022/11/16 #260
Kolmapäev täna \
Homme ei tule kiire \
Ma tean minu parim

## 2022/11/15 #259
Match the ticks and lines \
Import export the figures \
Impressively done

## 2022/11/14 #258
Discuss the merits \
Propagandized grandmothers \
Now anarchy reigns!

## 2022/11/13 #257
Sleeping in this morn \
Kitty went to climb, now wake \
Just kidding, sleep in!

## 2022/11/12 #256
Being secretive \
I'm a hidden chancellor \
Some time soon we'll win

## 2022/11/11 #254
Today is for vets \
Fuck all the military \
Death should not be praised

## 2022/11/10 #253
At colloquium \
Please don't fall asleep right now \
Tomorrow is rest

## 2022/11/09 #252
Searching for some trains \
The bell should go ding dong ding \
So, where is it now?


## 2022/11/08 #251
Coding the axes \
The beast is finally slain \
Now time for a nap

## 2022/11/07 #250
Morning meet and plan \
Discuss some stats and questions \
Where do we go now?

## 2022/11/06 #249
Gain ancient wisdom \
Restore order to the storm? \
Or avenge a ghost?

## 2022/11/05 #248
First day off in weeks \
On the couch where I belong \
Prepare tomorrow

## 2022/11/04 #247
Time is hanging down \
I can't do this anymore \
Drop that class so fast

## 2022/11/03 #246
Stabbed in the shoulder \
Disease courses through my veins \
Get sick purposely

## 2022/11/02 #245
I really need help \
Brain refuses to do math \
Assistance granted

## 2022/11/01 #244
Cold wind blasts with rain \
The sun rises, but hidden \
Gray skies for today
