## 2022/11/30 #275
Polygons decide \
Each face will tell a story \
Take a chance and roll

## 2022/11/29 #274
The month is ending \
Leaves have changed and now fallen \
Time marches forward

## 2022/11/28 #273
Oh how the time goes \
Where did it go though, just now? \
I am so confused

## 2022/11/27 #272
Changing of spirits \
Tradition and memories \
Building together

## 2022/11/26 #271
Separate again \
Trekking the woods in steel beasts \
Vacation resting

## 2022/11/25 #270
Hungover? Not me \
Traditions are how we go \
Growing up and out

## 2022/11/24 #269
Rise before the sun \
Drinking long before dinner \
Now what's for dessert?

## 2022/11/23 #268
Frequency scanning \
Intensity up and down \
Still can't find a train

## 2022/11/22 #267
Kirjuta sõnad \
Parandage need sõnad! \
Kui palju on jääd?

## 2022/11/21 #266
Touch up some figures \
Great news, we can start writing! \
Well, you write, he fix

## 2022/11/20 #265
From a hazy cloud \
Twin blades drawn twirling and slice \
Can you hear me now?

## 2022/11/19 #264
Early departure \
Already missing Kitty \
Let's go out Desna!

## 2022/11/18 #263
Explore the mansion \
Don't touch, everything is trapped \
Rogue got the sorc killed

## 2022/11/17 #262
Õpin oskusi \
Harjutan sõpredega \
Õppemine koos

## 2022/11/16 #261
Magasin hilja \
Koerad vooris muga \
Jää igavesti!

## 2022/11/16 #260
Kolmapäev täna \
Homme ei tule kiire \
Ma tean minu parim

## 2022/11/15 #259
Match the ticks and lines \
Import export the figures \
Impressively done

## 2022/11/14 #258
Discuss the merits \
Propagandized grandmothers \
Now anarchy reigns!

## 2022/11/13 #257
Sleeping in this morn \
Kitty went to climb, now wake \
Just kidding, sleep in!

## 2022/11/12 #256
Being secretive \
I'm a hidden chancellor \
Some time soon we'll win

## 2022/11/11 #255
Today is for vets \
Fuck all the military \
Death should not be praised

## 2022/11/10 #254
At colloquium \
Please don't fall asleep right now \
Tomorrow is rest

## 2022/11/09 #253
Searching for some trains \
The bell should go ding dong ding \
So, where is it now?


## 2022/11/08 #252
Coding the axes \
The beast is finally slain \
Now time for a nap

## 2022/11/07 #251
Morning meet and plan \
Discuss some stats and questions \
Where do we go now?

## 2022/11/06 #250
Gain ancient wisdom \
Restore order to the storm? \
Or avenge a ghost?

## 2022/11/05 #249
First day off in weeks \
On the couch where I belong \
Prepare tomorrow

## 2022/11/04 #248
Time is hanging down \
I can't do this anymore \
Drop that class so fast

## 2022/11/03 #247
Stabbed in the shoulder \
Disease courses through my veins \
Get sick purposely

## 2022/11/02 #246
I really need help \
Brain refuses to do math \
Assistance granted

## 2022/11/01 #245
Cold wind blasts with rain \
The sun rises, but hidden \
Gray skies for today
