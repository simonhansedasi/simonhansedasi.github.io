## 2022/04/30  #59
Fancy suit and tie \
Not as pretty as the wife \
Time to give money

---

## 2022/04/29  #58
Grandmas are coming \
Time to put down the baby \
Let them deal with her

---

## 2022/04/28  #57
Native words are tough \
I wish the past was not so \
We could be much more

---

## 2022/04/27  #56
Hiding from the sun \
Unintentionally, though \
Lots of trips outside

---

## 2022/04/26  #55
An extra hour \
Can make all the difference \
From dawn until dusk

---

## 2022/04/25  #54
In and out all day \
No time to do anything... \
It's not about me

---

## 2022/04/24  #53
An exciting drive \
Loud yelps, sweet breath, and kisses \
Her name is Desna

---

## 2022/04/23  #52
Clouds give way to sun \
Four legs, two legs, all walking \
Our animal bonds

---

## 2022/04/22  #51
Last school day until \
we bring home a new puppy \
New dog for our dog

---

## 2022/04/21  #50
Writing is not hard \
Just stare at a page until \
You bleed from your eyes

---

## 2022/04/20  #49
Meeting, teach, study \
Wednesday is my day to do \
No more, with puppy

---

## 2022/04/19  #48
Muscles burn this morn \
Resting on my feet all day \
Hungry, so hungry

---

## 2022/04/18  #47
Teaching takes up time \
I want to code all day long \
Balance, harmony

---

## 2022/04/17  #46
Mowed the lawn again \
Here we go around the sun \
Different each time

---

## 2022/04/16  #45
Practical magic \
Chicken wings and mimosas \
I love Saturdays

---

## 2022/04/15  #44
Office hours missed \
Why do I even bother \
Now there's a cat door

---

## 2022/04/14  #43
Haikus can be hard \
Sometimes they do not make sense \
Refrigerator

---

## 2022/04/13  #42
Bike to a meeting \
Run all the way home again \
Always modify

---

## 2022/04/12  #41
More roughage for lunch \
In a dark classroom all day\
What is for dinner?

---

## 2022/04/11  #40
Soft spots all up top \
I wanted solar panels \
Now we need a roof

---

## 2022/04/10  #39
Old games and new chores \
Hail falls over the city \
Poor us trapped inside.

---

## 2022/04/09  #38
Puppies under rain \
So many smells, tiny teeth \
Here comes the baby!

---

## 2022/04/08  #37
Upgraded again \
Terrified of thermal grease\
It's working so far...

---

## 2022/04/07  #36
Many things, one place \
Stretch so thin, can barely think \
Welcome to grad school

---

## 2022/04/06  #35
Rushing here and there \
Meetings, puppies, and dinner \
Ending a long day

---

## 2022/04/05  #34
Eating lunch early \
I don't want to teach hungry \
Already worried

---

## 2022/04/04  #33
Exhaustion creeping \
From every direction \
Training is so hard

---

## 2022/04/03  #32
Running with Kitty \
Harder than I remember \
Legs now turned to gel

---

## 2022/04/02  #31
Racing against clouds \
Chopping blades, fall under foot \
A cold brew after

---

## 2022/04/01  #30
Why, oh why Vim? Why? \
Unintuitive as hell \
Who the hell made this?!
