## 2022/04/18 #47
Teaching takes up time \
I want to code all day long \
Balance, harmony

## 2022/04/17 #46
Mowed the lawn again \
Here we go around the sun \
Different each time

## 2022/04/16 #45
Practical magic \
Chicken wings and mimosas \
I love Saturdays

## 2022/04/15 #44
Office hours missed \
Why do I even bother \
Now there's a cat door

## 2022/04/14 #43
Haikus can be hard \
Sometimes they do not make sense \
Refrigerator

## 2022/04/13 #42
Bike to a meeting \
Run all the way home again \
Always modify

## 2022/04/12 #41
More roughage for lunch \
In a dark classroom all day\
What is for dinner?

## 2022/04/11 #40
Soft spots all up top \
I wanted solar panels \
Now we need a roof

## 2022/04/10 #39
Old games and new chores \
Hail falls over the city \
Poor us trapped inside.

## 2022/04/09 #38
Puppies under rain \
So many smells, tiny teeth \
Here comes the baby!

## 2022/04/08 #37
Upgraded again \
Terrified of thermal grease\
It's working so far...

## 2022/04/07 #36
Many things, one place \
Stretch so thin, can barely think \e
Welcome to grad school

## 2022/04/06 #35
Rushing here and there \
Meetings, puppies, and dinner \
Ending a long day

## 2022/04/05 #34
Eating lunch early \
I don't want to teach hungry \
Already worried

## 2022/04/04 #33
Exhaustion creeping \
From every direction \
Training is so hard

## 2022/04/03 #32
Running with Kitty \
Harder than I remember \
Legs now turned to gel

## 2022/04/02 #31
Racing against clouds \
Chopping blades, fall under foot \
A cold brew after

## 2022/04/01 #30
Why, oh why Vim? Why? \
Unintuitive as hell \
Who the hell made this?!
