## 2022/03/17 #16
Splitting my notebooks \
More complex than I first thought \
All this for figures

## 2022/03/17 #15
Moving furniture \
More room for activities \
Great, now there's a glare

## 2022/03/16 #14
Halfway through the week \
Running errands fucking blows \
Now go make dinner

## 2022/03/15 #13
Got my new ID \
I hope it works for the bus  \
It probably won't

## 2022/03/14 #12
Back to modeling \
No, not that kind of model \
Glacier prethicktor

## 2022/03/13 #11
Coding on the couch \
Concatenating tables \
This time with money

## 2022/03/12 #10
Sleepy cuddle day\
Lasagna and games with friends\
After cleaning up

## 2022/03/11 #9
Morning sun, blinding \
At home all alone, waiting \
Kitty's wine must flow

## 2022/03/10 #8
All alone today \
Not even home with Bubby \
Traffic was a bitch

## 2022/03/09 #7
Lost motivation \
Hunger claws at my stomach \
I should eat some lunch

## 2022/03/08 #6
Legs feel like jelly \
Riding all the way to work \
Was a bad idea

## 2022/03/07 #5
Low clouds on my walk \
Jeans and pajamas are warm \
I'll work out later

## 2022/03/06 #4
Another long drive \
This time I'm going back home \
Then, more vidya

## 2022/03/05 #3
Woken by the sun \
Frost covers the ground outside \
Vidya, inside

## 2022/03/04 #2
Missing my Kitty \
Long drive to see family \
Worthwhile in the end

## 2022/03/03 #1
Riding in the rain \
My bike is brand spanking new \
I hope I don't die
