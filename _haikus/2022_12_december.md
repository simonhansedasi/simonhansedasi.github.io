It's the sixth today \
Not even a week in yet \
Out of things to say

## 2022/12/05 #280
Going for some lunch \
The two of us guys and him \
Oh and the speaker

## 2022/12/04 #279
This time I will write \
All that I have done so far \
He beat me to it

## 2022/12/03 #278
A stretched out cable \
Brings the needed energy \
To crunch the numbers

## 2022/12/02 #277
Research goals are near \
Yet so very, very far \
Optimization

## 2022/12/01 #276
First day of the month \
Fresh chance to start out all new \
It goes the same though
