## 2022/12/31 #304
symbols, falling leaves \
drifting and twirling, they seek \
a gentle landing


## 2022/12/30 #303
Tomorrow's haiku \
Will be from my good friend Steph \
Please write a poem

## 2022/12/29 #302
Snowy days reflect \
Blinding rays scorch my eyeballs \
Not with sunglesses

## 2022/12/28 #301
It's Wednesday my dudes \
That's an extra syllable \
Guess what? I don't care!

## 2022/12/27 #300
Five days left this year \
Motivation is now gone \
I'll start up next week

## 2022/12/26 #299
It's all broken now \
Oopsy, well, that's what it's for \
Oh well, there's next year

## 2022/12/25 #298
Tearing paper bows \
Grand gestures of love and need \
Trying to play faves?

## 2022/12/24 #297
Talents fly around \
I did mine and shared my love \
Just got bad coffee

## 2022/12/23 #296
Today is The Eve \
Tomorrow The Day and The Eve \
It's complicated

## 2022/12/22 #295
Once we go around \
In a circle, all the way \
We are at the start

## 2022/12/21 #294
I love our advent \
We bought gifts for each other \
A gift tomorrow

## 2022/12/20 #293
Oh, hey, in five days \
We will gather round a tree... \
Capitalism

## 2022/12/19 #292
Nineteen and then four \
I can't think, related how? \
Get off the number!

## 2022/12/18 #291
Eighteen is twice nine \
Please don't divide me in two \
Because I will die

## 2022/12/17 #290
Sore feet pound pavement \
Cold air chills my very bones \
Science will prevail!

## 2022/12/16 #289
Tomorrow I fly \
Today I print a poster \
And then I learn all

## 2022/12/15 #288
Two-Ninety over \
3 * 5 = 15 \
Not a multiple...

## 2022/12/14 #287
There is still some time \
Write write write write write some more \
Conference still looms

## 2022/12/13 #286
Once upon a time \
A dude had really long hair \
Then this bitch cut it

## 2022/12/12 #285
Here's a good idea \
If you have to do something \
Don't do it later

## 2022/12/11 #284
Try to remember \
Where you were three months ago \
Now write about it

## 2022/12/10 #283
Why did I do this? \
I did it all by myself \
This is like torture

## 2022/12/09 #282
Writing poetry \
Can be very difficult \
When under pressure


## 2022/12/08 #281
I have thirty more \
And then a lot more to go \
Before I'm caught up

## 2022/12/07 #280
Cooooofee Cooooooooooooffee more \
coffe coffee coffe please \
covfefe

## 2022/12/06 #279
It's the sixth today \
Not even a week in yet \
Out of things to say

## 2022/12/05 #278
Going for some lunch \
The two of us guys and him \
Oh and the speaker

## 2022/12/04 #277
This time I will write \
All that I have done so far \
He beat me to it

## 2022/12/03 #276
A stretched out cable \
Brings the needed energy \
To crunch the numbers

## 2022/12/02 #275
Research goals are near \
Yet so very, very far \
Optimization

## 2022/12/01 #274
First day of the month \
Fresh chance to start out all new \
It goes the same though
