## 2022/07/05 #125
So many ways to add \
Multiplying is something \
They're all different though

## 2022/07/04 #124
It's the fourth today \
I'm always proud and ashamed \
America, chill

## 2022/07/03 #123
Cold, wet, gray outside \
Puppies are always the best \
Even with shit weather

## 2022/07/02 #122
Saxon priest cut down \
Old viking dudes are so cool \
Oh, my model's done

## 2022/07/01 #121
Long hours paid off \
I get to nap afternoon \
Not on purpose, though
