## 2022/07/30 #150
Braided locks of gold \
Conversations with the old \
One thing, it's not cold


## 2022/07/29 #149
Posting up some figs \
Code is already in place \
Just run through the cells


## 2022/07/28 #148
Project in, project out \
So much going on this week \
They're good investments

## 2022/07/27 #147
Last day without air \
Finally they are finished \
Cold house, finally

## 2022/07/26 #146
Last day without air \
Too hot outside for working \
Finish tomorrow

## 2022/07/25 #145
Monday goes just fine \
Not much to mention today \
Barely remember

## 2022/07/24 #144
Waffles for breakfast \
Smoothie and a joint for lunch \
Chores never so nice

## 2022/07/23 #143
Saturday choppin' \
Cut down the leaves on the bush \
Now go pick them up


## 2022/07/22 #142
No more working now \
It's time for some major naps \
It can all wait some

## 2022/07/21 #141
Break from the coding \
Write some more words to explain \
This project is huge


## 2022/07/20 #140
Quick chat, lots of facts \
New things to spin up quickly \
Now time to focus

## 2022/07/19 #139
Feeling much better \
Occasionally cough \
Wait for that to go...

## 2022/07/18 #138
Finally she rests \
Only kinda though, still cleans \
I want my couch back

## 2022/07/17 #137
At least I'm not sick \
I get to play with my friends \
Bring on a new char

## 2022/07/16 #136
Have I gone crazy? \
Sick people should be resting \
It's the effin' plague!

## 2022/07/15 #135
The days blend sometimes \
Letting the clock run is bad \
I must keep my pace

## 2022/07/14 #134
Huge day for writing \
Sit down, shit out, then edit \
It's really not hard

## 2022/07/13 #133
Wednesday is two sounds \
It really should be three sounds \
Pronunciation

## 2022/07/12 #132
Tuesday is Tuesday \
Day two of the week's struggle \
Early morning meets

## 2022/07/11 #131
More analyzing \
Lots of work for some regions \
Some were accurate

## 2022/07/10 #130
Another day home \
Desna feeling much better \
Misses her bubby

## 2022/07/09 #129
Poor bb is ill \
Time is no loner a thing \
She is what matters

## 2022/07/08 #128
Poopy goes poopy \
All night long she cries \
Then morning naps

## 2022/07/08 #128
Finish what's not done \
Anchor to loosely laid boards \
A new bug also!

## 2022/07/07 #127
Strong arms, legs, and back \
Up and down the stairs we go \
Yummy BBQ

## 2022/07/06 #126
Lots of traveling \
Not like with a basketball \
But actual travel

## 2022/07/05 #125
So many ways to add \
Multiplying is something \
They're all different though

## 2022/07/04 #124
It's the fourth today \
I'm always proud and ashamed \
America, chill

## 2022/07/03 #123
Cold, wet, gray outside \
Puppies are always the best \
Even with shit weather

## 2022/07/02 #122
Saxon priest cut down \
Old viking dudes are so cool \
Oh, my model's done

## 2022/07/01 #121
Long hours paid off \
I get to nap afternoon \
Not on purpose, though
